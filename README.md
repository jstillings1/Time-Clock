Development, and programming of a Time Clock application in Java to replace a MS Access program written 10 + years ago.
o	Java Derby Database
o	Full reporting module
o	Full documentation of use

Notes: This was a solo self learned project for all concepts required to produce this product, as such their may be design flaws or better ways to do things that I was and am simply unware of. GUI applications was not covered in my college classes for Java. Specal thanks to Stack Overflow who was a hot bed of research on Java Derby and connection strings.

Note this is version 3.5 of progress. I am too ashamed of the learning progression of the other versions to post.
